### Optimized code base for a rim repair specialists webpage.  

## Features and Code!
<p align="center">
This webpage has many subtle but powerful effects that give it a polished feel.  The power of Javascript and CSS shines through in these before and after pictures.  The goal was to make the user feel as if they were walking through a white tiled car garage inspecting the handy work of my client. In order to achieve that I created a function to add the "Slide-In" class to the images when the users viewport intersected with where the images are planned to be.
