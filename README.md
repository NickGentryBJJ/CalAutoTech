## Tech Stack!

What began as a vanilla JavaScript project quickly escalated in complexity, leading me to realize that I had underestimated the volume of information and code required to meet the project's goals. Recognizing the need for a more manageable codebase, I opted to refactor the existing project using React. <br/>
This transition to React facilitated smoother implementation of client-suggested changes and enhancements. The result is an organized and cohesive codebase, prioritizing structure, readability, and functionality.<br/>

In this React project, I leveraged npm for package management and utilized webpack as the bundler. These tools played a crucial role in streamlining the development process and optimizing the project's build pipeline, showcasing my proficiency with industry-standard tools and workflows.<br/>

## Features and Code!
<p align="center">
This webpage boasts numerous subtle yet impactful effects that contribute to its polished appearance. Leveraging the capabilities of JavaScript and CSS, the before-and-after pictures shine with elegance. The overarching goal was to immerse the user in an experience reminiscent of strolling through a pristine white-tiled car garage, inspecting the meticulous craftsmanship of our client's work. To achieve this, a custom function was crafted to dynamically add the 'slide-in' class to designated images. As the user's viewport intersects with the designated area, the images gracefully slide into view, enhancing the immersive experience. <br/>
